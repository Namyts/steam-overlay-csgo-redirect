# Steam overlay homepage with automatic csgostats.gg redirection

### What:
	A simple react app which checks to see if a steam community url is in the clipboard when the page loads:
		- If there is: redirect to csgostats.gg
		- If there isn't: redirect to google.com

### Why:
	I found myself wanting to check opponent and player profiles frequently in csgostats.gg while playing. I don't want to change my default home page from google, since this is most practical in all other steam overlay browser use cases
